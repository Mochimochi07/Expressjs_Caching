# Expressjs_Caching

hey, this is my sample caching using expressjs and mysql.

caching is one of the important factors for making a powerful server.

caching is a way to store frequently requested data in a temporary storage location,

such as memory or a database, so that it can be accessed more quickly the next time it is needed. 

lets just say that caching is more like a RECENTLY VISITED PAGE THAT YOU MADE where you can just visit it over and over without causing traffic over the server.

Sorry about the all caps because im just emphasizing things to my self where i can also understand on times that i would just go back using express js.

well sometimes i really miss Gin golang though.

anyways, feel free to study caching.
